# Sample Markdown File

This is a **markdown** file to test the token counter extension.

## Features to Test

- Token counting with *Anthropic* tokenizer (default)
- Token counting with **OpenAI** tiktoken library
- File explorer integration
- Caching mechanism

## Code Example

```javascript
function example() {
    console.log("This code block should be tokenized too!");
}
```

## List Items

1. First item with some text content
2. Second item with more detailed explanation
3. Third item to increase token count

> This is a blockquote that adds more content for tokenization testing.

The extension should count all tokens including markdown formatting, code blocks, and regular text content.
